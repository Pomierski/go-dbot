# Go-DBOT

Very simple discord bot created only for my Golang practise. I will use it to try any new concepts or libraries which I may learn in the future.

## Glorious Features
- Get avatar of any discord user in your guild
- Get random dog image
- Get random cat image
- Get fancy discord embed to help you understand those advanced commands

## Usage 

Create config.json 
```
{
  "token": "yOuR_t0K3n_H3rE",
  "prefix": "$"
}
```

`go run main.go`
